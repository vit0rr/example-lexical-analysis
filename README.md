# Lexical Analysis in Gleam ⭐️ 

The [lexical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) is one of the steps to build an interpreter. It will be used to tokenize the input string into a list of tokens, which could be used to build the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). 

### How to run

The main file contains an example tokenizing a simple string and printing the tokens to the console. To run, use the following command:

```sh
gleam run
```

To explore more cases and longer strings, you can check and run the tests:

```sh
gleam test
```
